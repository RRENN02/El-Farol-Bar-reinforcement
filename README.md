# El-Farol-Bar-reinforcement
El Farol Bar Problem (Arthur, 1994): Every week, a group of people decides independently whether to go to a popular bar. If the bar is too crowded, they don't enjoy it. If too few people go, it's not lively enough. Each person must predict attendance and decide whether to go.
